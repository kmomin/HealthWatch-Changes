            <h2>Dr (Hon.) S. Senthil Kandeepan</h2>
            <h3>Founder, Managing Director and CEO</h3>
            <div class="team-desc">
              There are entrepreneurs and there are changemakers, but it is only rarely that a marriage of the two comes along in the mainstream, creating something of immense value as well as profound social impact. Senthil is of this rare pantheon, as attested by the feathers of recognition that adorn his young crown. <br><br>With multiple postgraduate degrees in business administration, labour management and public administration from Madras University in the nineties, he seemed primed for corporate life, which he kicked off with four triumphant years in the areas of talent management and industrial relations, on stints with the MRF and Taj Hotels by the Tata Group. <br><br>But not feeling connected enough to a social cause, for the next three years he immersed himself in rigorous preparation and study for the Indian Civil Services, not knowing that he was destined to throw himself into the service of humanity through a quite different route. <br><br>In 2005, in what was a culmination of years of dreaming about making significant positive change to human life, he founded Cardiopulse Heart Care (CHC), a company dedicated to moving healthcare into the future. It was a seminal moment, for the company quickly diversified into multiple entities including Healthwatch Telediagnostics, all of which to this day are dedicated to making healthcare smarter, more effective and affordable, and less intrusive. <br><br>But Senthil’s vision is not limited to clients, consumers and its employees who are the very lifeblood of the company but the community at large. A champion of the empowerment of underprivileged women, Senthil is dedicated to gender inclusivity, and his idea of “empowerment through employment” has resulted in a workforce that has more women than men, with most of the women employees being first generation graduates in their families. <br><br>For his contributions to bringing innovative healthcare practices to the mainstream in India and other southeast Asian countries in record time, Senthil has been decorated with several recognitions, including a ‘lifetime achievement’ award from several eminent personalities including Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, and an honorary doctorate for humanitarian services from the International University for Complementary Medicine in Colombo. <br><br>Senthil is an avid wildlife photographer, and has travelled to several countries in pursuit of the subliminal. He is also a fitness enthusiast, long distance runner and cyclist who has completed a staggering 20 full and half marathons in India and abroad, so his legacy is not the only enduring attribute. <br><br>Firmly rooted in experience, with ear glued to heart, his vision is always on a future in which he’ll have made a difference to every human life. And from his New Delhi office, where he’s based, as he marshals a committed team aligned with his vision, it is what occupies his days and dreams.

              Jayasri is the chief finance officer of the company and oversees the finance, books and accounts of our diversified business operations. <br><br>A seasoned finance professional, Jayasri is qualified as a chartered accountant from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and as a company secretary from the Institute of Company Secretaries of India. <br><br>Frightfully fond of numbers as a child, Jayasri was the proverbial frontbencher, acing all her tests and exams to the moon and back, and turning out a consistent topper in school and university. <br><br>Jayasri’s journey with CHC began as early as 2010 as a founding director of Healthwatch, before which she was heading the business banking team for northern India for ICICI Bank, India’s largest private bank at the time of writing, for more than seven years. She had also served in the international banking division of Standard Chartered Bank for about three years. <br><br>With a strong grounding in financial diligence, contingency planning and monetary sagacity, she ensures that we remain fiercely independent, self-reliant, debt free and nimble to take on ambitious growth plans without being hamstrung by the burden of financial liabilities or inclement risks. <br><br>Her astuteness and equanimity, drawn from her monumental experience in pecuniary matters, is ultimately key to our being able to practise the philosophy that the best missions are those that lead to the benefit of all at the expense of none.

              Ravi Shankar oversees our highly intricate and technical clinical operations division. Having joined us in 2016 and been the driving force behind our prodigious network of channel partners, Ravi presently is the guiding light of our large and growing team of highly qualified technicians who make our 24x7x365 cardiac-rhythm KPO services possible. He has been instrumental in Healthwatch home diagnostic services, enjoying a pan-India reach, with an overwhelmingly wide endorsement from practitioners, and inducting ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to our stellar array of diagnostic services. <br><br>A post graduate in labour studies with over 25 years’ experience in healthcare, publishing and functional areas of business development, sales, marketing, distribution, creative media, PR, branding, event management and NGO operations, Ravi is a man of multitudinous facets. Famous for taking up challenging projects and seeing them through to perfection, Ravi’s operational motto is, “dream big, and achieve bigger.” His embodiment of such a lofty credo is hard to doubt when you consider that he’s been responsible for launching Gotham Comics in India for its parent company, Gotham Entertainment LLC, based in New Jersey, USA. He’s also credited with launching PC World, the world’s largest computer magazine, in India, relaunching Chandamama, India’s favourite children’s magazine, after 60 years. <br><br>A dexterous negotiator and articulate public speaker, he practises what he calls ‘transformational leadership’, central to which is managing change, excelling at customer service, and effectively multitasking to lead by example, and motivate not by words but by the power of exemplary action. His distinctive qualities lie in the unspoken elements of thoughtfulness and a critical eye for detail. He is also marked by a  genuine interest in people, and believes the key to organisational growth is individual blossoming. “After all,” he quips, “even the journey of a million miles begin with traversing one.”

              <p>Avinash Kumar Issac, who has been part of our family since 2016, leads from the front and on the back of over a decade’s experience in the clinical realm. Avinash’s educational qualifications from the American academia exceed the length of a line even when shortened. However, his knowledge is anything but theoretical, backed as it is by the eclectic experience of working with various super-speciality hospitals, heart institutes, research centres and medical colleges. <br><br>He has worked, boots-in-the-mud, in emergency and casualty wards, cardiac catheterization laboratories, surgical theatres, cardiac rhythm monitoring laboratories and diagnostic departments, critical care and high dependency units, trauma ICUs, and even ACLS ambulances. He has also enjoyed a stellar stint in a medical college as a clinical educator, and is skilled in life-saving techniques, ventilator management, cardiac monitoring, modular ICUs, and is something of an authority in the latest cardiac interventions and other investigatory procedures. <br><br>All this combines to afford Avinash far-reaching expertise in heart rhythm analysis, cardiac interventions and emergency care management, which we naturally leverage to spectacular effect in the challenging arena of the real world. A cycling enthusiast, he loves exploring new places and playing outdoor sports. Having witnessed a lot of what can go wrong with the body, he’s also passionate about health and fitness to keep illnesses at bay. Avinash’s encyclopaedic array of knowledge, skills and abilities helps us offer a lot, and embed a lot in everything we offer.</p>

            <div class="team-desc team-desc7">
              <p>Sneha Kadam heads our prestigious all-women Mumbai office apart from heading the domestic sales and partnership management, where she plays an instrumental role in forging and nurturing ties with people and companies to transform healthcare in India. For Sneha, who’s been a part of our family since 2017, healthcare is not just another subject, but rather a deeply personal and meaningful involvement, and it informs everything for which she strives in both professional and personal capacities. <br><br>Her choice of career traces its genesis to when as a child she visited her ailing grandmother in hospital and was fascinated by the diagnostic devices in use. That innocent encounter planted the seed of a career far into the future, as many years later, she chose to become a biomedical engineer. After briefly working with The Asian Heart Institute, she moved to the United States seeking global exposure, earning a master’s degree in biomedical engineering from San Jose State University. Soon after, she worked at Stanford HealthCare in Palo Alto for half a decade as a clinical technology analyst, a tenure that granted her immense cognitive gains in contemporary healthcare. <br><br>But Sneha would never stay away from her domicile for too long. With an earnest aspiration to contribute to the wellbeing of her compatriots, in 2017 she moved back to India and joined Healthwatch in a position from which she could make an abiding difference.Among her other interests are dancing and cycling. She’s a certified Bombay Jam instructor and teaches underprivileged children in Mumbai for an NGO. With a firm focus on balance and wellbeing, Sneha typifies an accomplished professional who has learned that to do the best for the heart, it is necessary to think from it, too.</p>

            <div class="team-desc team-desc8">
              <p>Ensuring that all the messaging about the work we’re doing is not lost in translation is writer, editor and content strategist, Santosh Saligram, who heads our creative marketing and communications efforts. A qualified mechanical engineer, Santosh took up communications instead when he realised that he liked coaxing art out of words and pictures more than forcing it out of numbers and equations – a decision that has led to more than 15 years’ experience in shaping language and visuals into vehicles of connection and understanding. <br><br>Accordingly, Santosh is interested in the architecture of content that has an aesthetic goal as much as a functional one. He often describes his work as an act of “transmission of the emotional essence of a subject”, and pursues it through a verbal and visual language working in cohesion to produce the intended effect in everything he does, which includes web design, UI and UX architecture, corporate and internal communications, digital marketing, and social media content design and strategy. <br><br>A passionate photographer, filmmaker and storyteller, Santosh has formerly been the chief editor of a travel-and-photography company, a photography mentor for learners, and a tour leader for wildlife photography enthusiasts. He has also spearheaded successful efforts to bring technology into the assessment of spoken and written English skills in the Indian space. Santosh’s vision is to endow Healthwatch with a lasting identity that befits the tremendous work everybody at the company does, to reflect in everything we say, show and project, a glimpse of the technological prowess that we exercise daily at all levels, and through our content, create value and meaning for people who spend their precious time, bestowing on us their invaluable trust. After all, says he, if we look for beauty in everything we do, we’ll soon find everything in beauty.</p>

And for someone who sees work as sort of play, that is apt.</p>
