          <h1>Telling <span>the Truth</span> about <br>Your Blood Pressure.</h1>
          <div class="banner-para">
            <p>High blood pressure for long has been known to be a leading cause of heart attack, stroke and morbidity.</p>
            
            <p>Yet, do you know that the traditional way of measuring it has been found to be ineffective?</p>
            
            <p>The revelation that your blood pressure reading may be lying to you may come as a surprise, but research indicates that the one-off clinical blood pressure reading, a technique from the 1800s and now severely dated, has the potential to misdiagnose hypertension significantly.</p>
            
            <p>This means that, denied accurate knowledge of what’s really happening in your veins, you could be tragically ignoring the brewing of potentially crippling and fatal illnesses.</p>
            
            <p>Alternatively, due to a phenomenon called the ‘white coat response’, your blood pressure may spike up temporarily when being measured, and based on the false diagnosis resulting from this, you may be put on a lifetime of unnecessary medication. Frightening? Fortunately, there’s a solution.</p>

          <h1>The solution</h1>
          <div class="overflow">
            <p>Since high blood pressure can either spike up falsely or ‘hide’ when being measured, <br>the solution is to monitor it over a period of time and not just test it as a one-off event.</p>
            <p>That is precisely what the Healthwatch Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) <br>service does. It monitors your blood pressure over 24 hours, including during your <br>sleep, so there’s no room for doubt and only clarity all the way.</p>
            <p>With all the variables accounted for and vagaries cancelled out, you can then have a <br>reliable reading based on which your doctor can determine an appropriate course of <br>action.</p>
            <p>There is now ample evidence that ABPM is a much stronger predictor of <br>cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than conventional measurement.</p>
            <p>Analysis by British researchers at the University of Birmingham found that ABPM was <br>the most cost-effective way of diagnosing hypertension. This has been demonstrated <br>by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK. The <br>process – from diagnosis, to antihypertensive therapy and management of any <br>ensuing cardiovascular disease – was compared with other strategies. The use of <br>ABPM led to significant savings, largely through better targeting of treatment as a <br>result of increased diagnostic accuracy.</p>

            <div id="faq1" class="content collapse show" data-parent="#accordion">
              Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) is when your blood pressure is measured as you move around, living your normal daily life. It is measured for up to 24 hours.
            </div>

            </div>
            <div id="faq2" class="content collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
              A small digital blood pressure monitor is attached to a belt around your waist and connected to a cuff around your upper arm.
            </div>

            </div>
            <div id="faq3" class="content collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
              Absolutely! In fact the very idea is to measure your blood pressure as you conduct your regular life and do everyday things. The device is therefore small enough not to affect your normal daily life.

              Your doctor might prescribe this test to: <br>
              a. Establish a diagnosis of high blood pressure (hypertension)<br>
              b. Eliminate the possibility of inaccuracies in your blood pressure reading due to the ‘white coat effect’<br>
              c. Decide if blood pressure medication, or any change to your current medication is required<br>
              d. Help to decide whether any change to your medication is required<br>
              e. Specifically measure your night-time blood pressure

              Q : How does it work?

            <div id="faq6" class="content collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
            This type of blood pressure measurement is similar to your usual blood pressure measurement: an electronic monitor takes your blood pressure by inflating a cuff around your upper arm and then slowly releasing the pressure. Normally, the monitor is fitted at your home or any location of your choice for your convenience. It will be placed inside a protective cover and it is important that it remains in this for the duration of the monitoring.<br><br>
            The machine then takes blood pressure readings at regular intervals throughout the day. Normally this is around every 15 minutes during the day and 30 minutes at night.<br><br>
            If asked, you will need to keep the monitor on throughout the night; many people put the machine under the pillow or on the bed while they sleep. At the end of the monitoring period we will visit you again to remove the machine, download the data, and send you and your doctor the report.

              We recommend you avoid showering or bathing during the monitoring period since you will have to take the device off to do this (as it’s not waterproof), and you may find it difficult to wear it back in the original and desired position.

            <div id="faq8" class="content collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
              No; the device is not waterproof and must not come into contact with water.
